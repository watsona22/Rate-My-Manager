## Description

Rate My Manager provides options to browse and compose ratings for managers by business location. The dynamic components of our website are supported by JavaScript. The application uses Express.js backend to retrieve rating and manager data. We also used mysql and Sequelize to query the database and render data based on user requests.  Finally, we incorporated a working API, CSS framework, and Handlebars.js packages to improve browsability as well as the overall look and feel of the site.

Our acceptance criteria were as follows: 

## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN that a user wants to find manager ratings,
THEN he selects a business by location chooses a manager and those reviews are displayed.
GIVEN that a user wants to rate a manager,
THEN the user is prompted to login,
WHEN the user is authenticated he will be prompted with an option to rate the current manager.
WHEN the user completes the rating, he will have the option to review the entry, return to the main page, or logout. 
```

All criteria were met and the site functions as expected. 

## Usage

Rate My Manager can be used to find and rate managers - both good and bad - to create a crowdsourced resource for current and prospective employees who want to know what to expect on the job.  And of course, you can post anonymously, as needed.

<ul>

<li>Contribute to a community of transparency so you know what to expect from your supervisor.</li>
</ul>
